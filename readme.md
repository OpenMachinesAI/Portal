# The Portal2 Protocal
### Our Portal 2 Protocol is a system designed to host websites on a webserver close to the conventional internet. 
### What sets it apart is its capability to enable interaction among Portal 2 sites, creating a network where these sites can seamlessly communicate and pull from others to update data. 
### One of Portal2's key features is the implementation of a centralized login system, simplifying user authentication across various Portal 2 sites. Additionally, the protocol facilitates real-time updates of information between interconnected sites, ensuring that changes made on one site are reflected across the network. 
### This interconnectedness opens up new possibilities for collaboration and data exchange within the Portal 2 ecosystem, enhancing the overall user experience and functionality of the platform.
